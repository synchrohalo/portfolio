          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Around April last year, I attempted the <a class="ext-link" target="_blank" href="https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days">100 Day Project</a>, my aim being to make an animated GIF everyday. Although I ended up with only 57 entries, doing this project rekindled my love for illustration and I've been trying to draw more often since.</p>

          <p>I started the 100 Day Project to get myself out of a creative rut. For a long time before then, I hadn't been making anything for fun. This project was challenging&mdash;some days I felt inspired and, on others, had to force myself to sit down and complete an animation, whether or not I was happy with the result.</p>

          <p>Like other artists, I constantly feel dissatisfaction with my creations. Over the course of the project, I gradually came to accept whatever I came up with and acknowledged that I could only get better from there. Here are some of my favorite GIFs from the project.</p>

          <h3>Day 10</h3>
          <p>I wanted to make something pink and cutesy&mdash;the perfect excuse to illustrate some chocolate-covered strawberries!</p>

          <h3>Assorted Food</h3>
          <p>A collection of food animations I made on different days. Clockwise, from the top left, the images are of a <em>siopao</em> (the Filipino version of a <em>baozi</em>, or steamed bun), Korean tofu stew or <em>soondubu</em>, a cross section of a <em>xiao long bao</em> or soup dumpling, and Hong Kong egg waffles (called eggettes or egg puffs) taking shape on a pan.</p>
