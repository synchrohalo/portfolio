          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>The <a href="https://daviscsclub.org/" target="_blank">Davis Computer Science Club</a> (DCSC) is an organization at UC Davis dedicated to serving CS students or those interested in the field. I was elected to be Marketing Director for the 2014-2015 school year, my responsibility mainly being to oversee the creation and distribution of marketing materials.</p>

          <h2 class="center">About</h2>	  
          <p>Although not formally a project, my role as Marketing Director with the Davis Computer Science Club was a year-long commitment that helped me grow as a designer and as a person.</p>
				
          <p>Prior to my incumbency, my leadership skills were pretty much non-existent. Even at the beginning, I struggled to speak up during meetings because I was too shy and felt like I had nothing to contribute. I took the position primarily because of my interest in graphic design and concentrated mostly on that.</p>
          
          <p>With a desire for change (and a little coaxing from the President at the time), I decided to step up and be more involved in my role. I proposed and planned a club t-shirt design contest and successfully ran a <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> tournament in coordination with the quasi-<em>Melee</em>-club on campus. Together with two other officers, I organized a <em>Gender Diversity in Technology</em> event. I also took charge of generating club funds for the year.</p>
          
          <p>Along with my personal growth, I tried to push myself to be a better designer as well. I began spending more and more time on each Facebook event banner, adding a focus on illustration. The following banners are my favorites among the bunch.</p>

          <img class="wide" src="../img/works/cs/winter-classes.png" alt="a powder blue banner that says 'Winter 2015 Classes Preview' with a snowflake detail behind the text and the top right corner of a notebook on the left side, showing a drawing of a snowman with a speech bubble saying: 'I heart-symbol DCSC'"/>
          <h3>Winter Classes Preview</h3>
          <p>Every quarter, DCSC holds an event to discuss upcoming computer science courses and give students advice on what to expect. I decided to add the little drawing of the snowman on the side to make the banner look more fun and to make our club feel more welcoming.</p>

          <img class="wide" src="../img/works/cs/jan-meeting.png" alt="a banner that says 'January General Meeting' with rolling snow-covered hills in the background and a young, dark-haired child on the right side exclaiming: 'And a LAN party with board games, too, woo-hoo!'"/>
          <h3>January General Meeting</h3>
          <p>I made this during winter break, and, because I had more time on my hands, I went for a more illustration-heavy banner. I picked muted off-white colors for the background to make the text and the reds stand out. In hopes of increasing attendance, I added a cute character on the right with a speech bubble to give details about the event.</p>

          <h3>Spring Classes Preview</h3>
          <p>Another seasonal-themed piece. For the spring classes preview, I stuck with a more simple design, choosing to decorate the banner with geometrically "perfect" flowers and a little bee to break the uniformity.</p>

          <h3>Development Hub</h3>
          <p>Later during the school year, one of our officers had an idea for an event that would allow students of any major to get together once a week, form groups if desired, and just work on any projects of interest. This event was entitled <em>Development Hub</em>, or <em>Dev Hub</em>, for short. At the suggestion of a friend, I used a rocket ship to represent the idea of a launch pad, or, figuratively speaking, a good place to begin a new undertaking.</p>

          <h3>2015 Elections</h3>
          <p>My personal favorite. My color choices were meant to parallel those of the U.S. flag to evoke a patriotic and spirited response. The passing of the torch is a symbol commonly used to illustrate the handing down of roles, and I thought it appropriate for the image. I also wanted to suggest a sense of movement (with the positioning of the ribbon and the hands) to designate a "call to action" of sorts.</p>

          <p>Joining DCSC was one of the best decisions I've ever made, and I'm glad to have been part of something so influential on a portion of the student population.</p>
