            <h2>Dino Think Android App</h2>
            <h3>UI/UX Design, Front-end Code</h3>
          </div>

          
          <h3>Platform</h3>
          <p>Android mobile app via Adobe PhoneGap</p> 

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>The Design Thinking mobile app was one of the projects commissioned for the UC Davis Computer Science/Computer Science & Engineering department’s senior design project course. My team's progress was overseen by the client, Helen Liang, CEO of startup UstartX Inc. based in Menlo Park, CA.</p>

          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>To create a mobile app that assists a user in solving a problem by taking him/her/them through the design thinking process and recording the progress made at each step.</p>

          <h2 class="center">Process</h2>	  
          <p>The client wanted an mobile app that would facilitate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking" target="_blank">design thinking process</a> on-the-go. Working in a team of four, I took the reins on designing the app's interface and, together, we spent countless discussions on the overall user flow.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the most challenging part of the project was figuring out how the app would work. I'd learned a little about the design thinking process in an introductory design course, but my teammates were completely new to the concept at the time. We struggled with grasping the importance of the process, as our first run-through of it (via Stanford d.school's <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/" target="_blank">crash course</a>) as a team had been a frustrating and stressful experience. Consequently, we failed to develop a useful and comprehensive user flow.</p>

          <p>Despite this setback, we pushed onward. One of our initial ideas was to make the app an all-encompassing design thinking “toolbox”. Each step of the design thinking process could be navigated using the color-coded tabs at the top: blue for Empathy, green for Define, yellow for Ideate, orange for Prototype, and red for Test (as inspired by Stanford d.school’s representation of the process).</p>

          <img src="../img/works/dino/mockup-play.png" alt="early mockups for the app which have a colorful look and access to every design thinking tool on the same page"/>
          <h3>A Holistic Toolbox</h3>
          <p>The iOS- and Instagram-inspired navigation bar would contain different utilities: camera, video camera, voice recorder, notepad, timer, and brainstorming tools, which would vary depending on the current design thinking step. The user would be able to use any of these at will—no constraints, just constantly accessible tools to meet the user’s current needs.</p>

        <div class="col-10">
          <p>Thankfully, the team's constant communication with Helen put us on the right track. After receiving her feedback on this design, we were able to better understand her vision for the app, which was a more heavily guided, step-by-step demonstration of the design thinking process. The app was intended to be beginner-friendly so that any user could learn how to find human-centered solutions for the problems surrounding them. Each individual use of the app (which would ideally be completed within an hour) would result in a prototype that aims to solve the problem at hand.</p>
				
          <p>Although the team had a negative first experience, we opted to model the app’s flow after Stanford d.school’s crash course. We believed that if we were to break everything down and explain each step carefully, this procedure would give users a good introduction to design thinking and would yield tangible results in a short amount of time.</p>
          
          <p>My design concept was to take the above procedure and let it play out like a game—I was thinking <em>WarioWare</em> or <em>Dumb Ways to Die</em>—in which players are subject to a series of “mini-games” that are to be completed within an allotted amount of time. The "mini-games", in this case, would be timed activities, such as sketching out ideas or brainstorming with a mind map.</p>

          <h3>Fast-Paced Fun</h3>
          <p>In the same vein as the aforementioned games, the app would take the user through sub-steps of the design thinking process, each with a specific goal and with a time limit to keep the user’s ideas as intuitive as possible.</p>

          <p>We planned on limiting the amount of text displayed on each page and using overlays to provide additional information. We wanted goals to be the focus of the page, when applicable, so that users could always keep them in mind. Every explanation was to be broken down to make it easier to digest the overwhelming amount of information provided.</p>

          <p>All throughout, the user would be prompted to take a picture of any notes, sketches, or prototypes to keep track of the progress made.</p>
