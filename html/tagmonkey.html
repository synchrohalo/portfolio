          </div>

          
          <h3>Platform</h3>
          <p>Website and web app</p> 

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>TagMonkey is a startup based in San Francisco, consisting of a small yet robust team of people. As fate would have it, I was asked to come on board and help with the designs. The following consists of my progress after working with them over the past few months.</p>

          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>To design a universal wireless tracking platform that allows for various types of analytics such as trends, inventory accuracy, and tracking device statuses.</p>

  <!----- PROCESS ----->

          <h2 class="center">Process</h2>	  
          <p>My first task at hand was to design a quick and dirty landing page to explain TagMonkey's platform and get beta signups. Because the company is fairly young, I didn't have too many resources such as high-quality stock images relevant to the product&mdash;in fact, the product didn't yet exist at that point in time. Instead, I tried to play my strengths and make a more graphic-heavy website.</p>

          <p>To begin with, I was given a basic two-color palette (the blue and orange you'll see below) and a makeshift logo. After looking for some inspiration from other websites, I found that I was most drawn to landing pages with great impact, usually from a large, striking image. I tried to emulate that with a large illustration of a monkey, holding up a smartphone to showcase the product.</p>

          <p>With the help of the team members, I broke down each of Tagmonkey's features into short descriptions, and I created 18 different icons to help illustrate the concepts. I also attached an onboarding form at the bottom of every informational page on the site to draw as many users as possible.</p>

          <h3>Unique Icons</h3>
          <p>One of the icons I made for the website. This one in particular was to represent the concept of "brand activation".</p>

          <p>After working the website, the next step was to actually <em>create</em> TagMonkey's flagship product&mdash;a web app that uses RFID technology to track inventory, event-goers, tools, or documents; basically, whichever use case is most relevant to a client's storefront. The user can view the obtained data and create custom analytics in their best interest.</p>

          <p>The first step was to design the look of the user's homepage, which, in this case, was to display the user's chosen analytics and stats. Examples of this would be total inventory count, the state of each RFID scanner (whether they were live or down), or, in a retail setting, a graph of which items were most popular over a period of time. We needed a modular way to display the data and settled on using the card UI pattern. To ensure reusability of each card, I designed a template for three different types of cards: those with a single data point (e.g. taking count of some item), those indicating the state of a zone's devices, and those with a data point and a graph.</p>

          <p>Each card with a graph would have a thumbnail of its respective graph for visual purposes. The user could then expand the card to view the graph in detail.</p>

          <p>One of the key features of TagMonkey's product is the Query Builder, which gives users the ability to input various filters and view a desired data point and/or graph. Through this feature, users can create their own cards to be displayed on the dashboard and further customize the app according to their needs.</p>
