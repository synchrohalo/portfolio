            <h2>Takeyout Mobile App</h2>
            <h3>UI/UX Design, Front-end Code</h3>
          </div>

          
          <h3>Platform</h3>
          <p>iOS & Android mobile app via PhoneGap on Ionic framework</p> 

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>This mobile app was a project I worked on during my recent internship at UstartX Inc. I worked with two other interns who were in charge of the client- and server-side code.</p>

          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>To create a mobile app that connects professionals on business travel with locals or with one another to help them feel a sense of belonging in a new environment.</p>

  <!----- PROCESS ----->
  <div class="works-process">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-1 hidden-sm"></div>
        <div class="col-10">
          <h2 class="center">Process</h2>	  
          <p>By request of the client, the user would be able to network with other professionals through the app, schedule upcoming trips to meet people ahead of time, and set up meetings with others by proposing a date, time, and location. Post-meeting, the user would be prompted to rate the meeting experience to establish and reinforce user credibility.</p>

          <p>My teammates and I decided to go with a Tinder-style UI as it has proved very effective in allowing users to quickly browse through profiles and choose whom to meet. Because the app requires a wider scope of functionality, we included a tabs bar to keep navigation more organized and consistent.</p>

          <p>The user’s home page shows a list of upcoming trips with a user’s hometown pinned at the top. From there, the user can look through other user profiles and choose whom he/she/they want to meet. Two connected users become “friends,” and a chat automatically forms between them so they can get to know each other and discuss meeting places and times. On the Calendar page, users are able to view their upcoming meetings, accept or decline pending requests, and also schedule new meetings with friends.</p>

          <img src="../img/works/takeyout/messages.jpg" alt="a handdrawn wireframe showing how messages between users are orgranized by where the two users first connected"/>
          <h3>Organization is Priority</h3>
          <p>Remembering things is easier when making associations between two different things. Using this principle, the chat list is organized based on trips the user has been on so that friends can be found more effortlessly.</p>

        <div class="col-10"> 
          <p>As the app’s target demographic is professionals, I tried to keep the style simple and thought a flat design would work best. However, I added dimensions when I saw fit. For instance, specific elements cast a shadow to simulate layers and to render them more visible when overlaid on a background.</p>

          <h3>Inspired by Travel</h3>
          <p>Aesthetics-wise, the client wanted a fun and energizing look. I decided on an orange color scheme with teal highlights, influenced by two Taiwan airport brochures a friend showed me from his travels.</p>
